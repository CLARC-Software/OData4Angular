# AngularOdataV401

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

Originally a fork of angular-odata-es5 https://github.com/StefH/angular-odata-es5 with changes to accommodate OData Version 4.01, which changed some Http Header Fields. https://github.com/mgrcto/angular-odata-v4_01

Now an angular library created with the cli. Since the fork on which the original library was build on https://github.com/mattlewis92/generator-angular-library could not be updated to run as an ivy package.
