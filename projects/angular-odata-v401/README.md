# @mgrcto/AngularOdataV401

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

Originally a [fork](https://github.com/mgrcto/angular-odata-v4_01) of [angular-odata-es5](https://github.com/StefH/angular-odata-es5) with changes to accommodate OData Version 4.01, which changed some Http Header Fields.

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mgrcto/lib-workspace) with Demo and Tests. 

Now an angular library created with the cli. Since the [fork](https://github.com/mattlewis92/generator-angular-library) on which the original library was build on could not be updated to run as an ivy package.
